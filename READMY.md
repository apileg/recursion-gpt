1. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

    - The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
    - For example, the factorial of 5 is `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.
    - Task: Write a recursive function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of `n`. For example, `factorial(5)` should return `120`.

2. Write a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

    - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    - The sequence starts with 0 and 1. For example, the first few numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
    - Task: Write a recursive function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the `n`th number in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, `fibonacci(6)` should return `8`.

3. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of an array of numbers.

    - Task: Write a recursive function `sumArray(arr)` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.
    - For example, `sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `15`.

4. Write a recursive function to find the maximum number in an array.

    - Task: Write a recursive function `findMax(arr)` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the array.
    - For example, `findMax([5, 8, 2, 10, 3])` should return `10`.

5. Write a recursive function to reverse a string.

    - Task: Write a recursive function `reverseString(str)` that takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order.
    - For example, `reverseString("hello")` should return `"olleh"`.

6. Write a recursive function to check if a word is a palindrome.

    - A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "level" and "radar" are palindromes.
    - Task: Write a recursive function `isPalindrome(word)` that takes a word as input and returns `true` if the word is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
    - For example, `isPalindrome("level")` should return `true`.

7. Write a recursive function to calculate the power of a number.

    - Task: Write a recursive function `power(base, exponent)` that takes a base and an exponent as input and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent.
    - For example, `power(2, 3)` should return `8`.

8. Write a recursive function to flatten an array.
    - Flattening an array means converting a nested array structure into a flat array. For example, `[1, [2, [3, 4]]]` should be flattened to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    - Task: Write a recursive function `flattenArray(arr)` that takes a nested array as input and returns a flat array.
    - For example, `flattenArray([1, [2, [3, 4]]])` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
